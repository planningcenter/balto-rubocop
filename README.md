# üê∫ Balto

Balto is Smart and Fast:

* Installs _your_ versions of rubocop and rubocop extension gems
* _Only_ runs on files that have changed
* _Only_ annotates lines that have changed

Sample config (place in `.github/workflows/balto.yml`):

```yaml
name: Balto

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  rubocop:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      - uses: planningcenter/balto-rubocop@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Local testing

1. Setup [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) (`brew install act`)
2. `npm test` (Note: this will download a large (6-12gb) docker image that
   matches what is ran on a GitHub action run)
